# Austin Lilygren Portfolio

This is a fully responsive full-stack portfolio built with npx create-react-app away from jordans version of js-generate

## What to expect inside

An application using a self built version of webpack a newly learned RTE called CKEeditor used mostly in all Forms on the admin side.

it also utilizes a jwt token to keep a user logged in and its own image rendering self taught so it doesnt rely on sending the image to an external site to possibly be stolen or copied from. 

Media styles are still being built out so down to phone size renders are pretty spotty but im still working on it.
